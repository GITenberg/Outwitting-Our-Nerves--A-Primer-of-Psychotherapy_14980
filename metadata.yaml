description: '"''Your trouble is nervous. There is nothing we can cut out and there
  is nothing we can give medicine for.'' With these words a young college student
  was dismissed from one of our great diagnostic clinics. The physician was right.
  In a nervous disorder there is nothing to cut out and there is nothing to give medicine
  for. Nevertheless there is something to be done--something which is as definite
  and scientific as a prescription or a surgical operation. Psychotherapy, which is
  treatment by the mental measures of psycho-analysis and re-education, is an established
  procedure in the scientific world to-day. Nervous disorders are now curable, as
  has been proved by the clinical results in scores of cases from civil life, under
  treatment by Freud, Janet, Prince, Sidis, DuBois, and others; and in thousands of
  cases of war neuroses as reported by Smith and Pear, Eder, MacCurdy, and other military
  observers.'
